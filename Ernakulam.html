    <p>Get away from the city with a private day tour to Athirappilly Waterfalls (the largest falls in the state) and the nearby Vazhachal Waterfalls. Your driver will pick you up in Kochi and take you out to the two waterfalls, with a stop at the Ezhattumugam Hanging Bridge along the way. You'll then head to lunch at a 4-star resort before returning to Kochi.</p>

    <p>St. George’s Forane Church Edappally, locally known as 'Edappally Palli' is a Catholic pilgrimage church in Edapally, Kochi, India. Being Asia’s largest shrine to Saint George, about five million people visit it every year. The church is believed to have been founded in 593 AD. It is regarded as one of the oldest churches in Kerala, after the seven churches founded by Thomas the Apostle in the first century AD. The church was originally dedicated to the Virgin Mary (Marth Mariam).</p>
